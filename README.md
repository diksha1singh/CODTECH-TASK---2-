OVERVIEW OF PROJECT 
Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression
*Objective*
The objective of this project is to build a simple linear regression model to predict housing prices in Boston based on the average number of rooms per dwelling.

*Key Activities*
Load Dataset and Libraries: Load the Boston Housing dataset and necessary Python libraries.
Explore the Dataset: Analyze the dataset for its structure, summary statistics, and check for missing values.
Split the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the Model: Create and train a linear regression model using the training data.
Evaluate the Model: Assess the model’s performance using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
Visualize Results: Visualize the regression line and compare actual vs. predicted housing prices.

*Technologies Used*
Python: Programming language used for analysis and model building.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Numerical computations.
Matplotlib: Data visualization.
Seaborn: Statistical data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.

*Key Insights*
Dataset Structure: The dataset consists of 506 samples and 14 features, including the target variable (PRICE).
Feature Selection: We use the average number of rooms per dwelling (RM) as the feature for our model.
Model Coefficients: The linear regression model provides an intercept and a coefficient that indicate the relationship between the feature (RM) and the target variable (PRICE).
Model Performance: The model's performance is evaluated using MSE and R² metrics, which help in understanding the accuracy and predictive power of the model.
Visualization: Visualizations such as the regression line plot and actual vs. predicted values scatter plot provide a visual understanding of the model's performance.
